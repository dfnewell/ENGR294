# ENGR294
Arduino Code for SFSU ENGR 294 class
In this repository you will find the code and breadboard layouts to successfully run the experiments for SFSU's Introduction to MicroControllers (ENGR 294).
Before using this code you must install the Arduino IDE and configure it to work with your board. For more information on how to do this see: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno

Detailed instructions are provided via the class's ilearn page. Below is a quick summary of the project codes for your reference.

CODE 1: PWM_AnalogRead
- Understanding PWM and AnalogRead()

CODE 2: LED_and_Photocell
- Your first project using a light sensor

CODE 3: Light_Controller
- Take your light sensor project and start doing stuff with it!

CODE 4: Low-Level SONAR system
- Use the HC-04 Ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to make a low-grade SONAR system!
- The best part is you can make it look like Wall-E =)
